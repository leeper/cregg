Description: Simple tidying, analysis, and visualization of conjoint (factorial) experiments, including estimation and visualization of average marginal component effects ('AMCEs') and marginal means ('MMs') for weighted and un-weighted survey data, along with useful reference category diagnostics and statistical tests. Estimation of 'AMCEs' is based upon methods described by Hainmueller, Hopkins, and Yamamoto (2014) <doi:10.1093/pan/mpt024>.
